CLI Logic:

- need to create commands for:

  - Create functionaliy
    - arguments (positional?) for name of company, position, and if I want to store application (optional)
    - with input data from cli, run corresponding method

  - Read functionaliy
    - argument (positional?) for specific company or position to search for, otherwise list all jobs

  - Update functionaliy
    - argument for company or position to update and their new values

  - Delete functionaliy
